                <p>
                    This is my first completed shader! This shader came about because I was originally trying to update
                    the visuals in another project. However I decided on turning this whole process as a standalone
                    project(for reasons I'll delve into later on).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The intent here was to develop a shader inspired by Mike
                    Mignolas artwork.
                    Mike Mignola is the creator Hellboy, and I've been a massive fan of his work for some time.
                    His style features heavy, almost overpowering black shadows, minimal linework, and strong contrasts.
                </p>

                <h2>Breaking down the Style</h2>
                <p>
                    Recreating an artists style with a shader involves breaking down all the elements that make up that
                    style first. So I was trying to discover all the common elements that really made Mignolas work
                    stand out.
                </p>
                <img class="proj-img" src="../Assets/HBY25YC_HBYICM_FC_FNL.jpg" />
                <p>
                    Obviously the shadows are one of the main focal points here, but it's also worth noting that
                    Mignolas work
                    varies in the amount of detail depending on the particular piece. From the linework to the use of
                    pure flats
                    over a slight gradiant, or the fact that some objects might feature multiple colors over a single
                    monotone.

                <p>
                    Not to mention the rimlight that appears in some heavily detailed images. This light is
                    interesting, as it typically appears in the darkest shadows to draw out more detail.

                <h1>Implimenting the Shader</h1>
                <p>
                    So for my shader, I wanted to feature the heavy black shadows, flat colors, and somehow implimenting
                    that shadowy rimlight. Additionally, I'd have to draw outlines to really nail that comic book look.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again, this project branched off from another. That original shader was a Lit shader that took some
                    notes from toon style shaders, the shadows were stepped and based off the diffuse instead of using a
                    ramp texture. I specifically did this because I was able to target where the lighting could be cut
                    off on a per-object basis. I also had a rimlight that only appeared in the diffuse that can be
                    recolored, and an outline that was drawn drawn from a models backface, but had to be thrown on each
                    object manually.
                </p>
                <img class="proj-img" src="../Assets/AHS-Pass0.png" />
                <p>
                    Not great, but it was a start.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>Shadow Rimlights</h2>
                <p>
                    The next stage here was to draw out detail in the shadow, I needed that rimlight to appear ONLY in
                    the darkest areas in the shadow. I was able to do this by taking the fresnel effect I had in the
                    diffuse, and multiplying the values in the dot product by -1.
                </p>
                <img class="proj-img" src="../Assets/AHS-ReverseFresnel.png" />
                <p>
                    Here's the result down below, I was pretty happy with it! Additionally I could change the colors if
                    necessary.
                </p>
                <img class="proj-img" src="../Assets/AHS-Pass1.png" />
                <br>

                <h2>Outlines and Self Shadows</h2>
                <p>
                    Now in the previous images, it's pretty obvious that drawing outlines from a models backface is kind
                    of not... great. There are a lot of holes to be filled, and the effect doesn't look good. So I
                    sought to fix this by using a Sobel filter as a post processing effect. The filter runs through the
                    depth texture to draw outlines, but also runs over opaque textures to sample color, all these values
                    can be tweaked independently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, there is a slight self-shadowing effect with lit shaders that heavily impedes the
                    Sobel filters ability to draw outlines. So it was at this point that I converted the shader from lit
                    to unlit. Which had a few trade offs, I gained a nice flat tone for my shader, and the shadow
                    artifacts were gone, which is exactly what I wanted, but the shader lost the ability to receive
                    shadows... There are a few fixes for this,
                    however I was warned by several others that the effort to deal with this issue was not worth it.
                    Either the solution would be wildly harsh on performance, or so tedious that it was simply not worth
                    the time invested. Regardless, here is the results down below.
                </p>
                <img class="proj-img" src="../Assets/AHS-Pass2.png" />
                <p>
                    I was liking where this was going! Though, since the Sobel was drawing lines over the specular
                    lights and wherever colors were meeting, I needed a way to tone it down a bit.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Final Outcome</h2>
                <img class="proj-img" src="../Assets/AHS-Pass3.png" />
                <p>
                    And here we are! Toned down the Sobel a bit so it'd stop choking the rim-lights, and I included a
                    few shapes and options with both rimlights on/off. Overall I'm happy with the project, but I'd like
                    to take another shot at this in the future. With the outlining I'd like to either add a few more
                    Sobel Filters that handle different things, or maybe find another solution for the outlining.
                    Additionally I'd like to resolve the self-shadowing somehow, so I think I'll have another
                    go at this with another version of Unity.
