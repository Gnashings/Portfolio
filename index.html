                        Worked with the other programmers on my team to bring our questing
                        system to life. I had written out and UML'd the designs that we programmed,
                        down here is us showcasing the dialogue for each stage, which we set up with enums.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We made heavy use of Primary Data Assets, Structs, and Data Tables here to work on what
                        we have so bar.

                        is a game where you control a tank, and fire at turrets and armored cars. So naturally it needed
                        there are a ton of explosions, bullets on the screen, and particle effects. For this project, I
                        wanted to really try to learn object pooling to save a little performance in the game.
                    </p>
                    <img class="proj-img" src="Assets/ObjectPool1.png" />
                    <p>
                        Object pooling is an optimization technique, where use reusable objects instead
                        of constantly instantiating the object. So we use it here for projectiles in our game,
                        but we have to set up these objects, so here we grab each one, set it's attributes,
                        and set it up in the queue.
                    </p>
                    <img class="proj-img" src="Assets/ObjectPool2.png" />
                    <p>
                        Here we actually pop the queued object, set it active, then rotate to the proper position.
                        Pretty easy stuff, but you just have to be mindful about stopping motion before the bullet
                        gets called back!

                        is a game where you control a tank, and fire at turrets and armored cars. So naturally it needed
                        to
                        have a ton of explosions, some applying just force, some with certain VFX, most with dealing
                        damage.
                        Since every explosion needed to have different parameters, I wanted to ensure my designers had
                        access to everything from radius to force to VFX.
                    </p>
                    <img class="proj-img" src="Assets/ExplosionSO.png" />
                    <p>
                        The first thing was to create the scriptable object.
                        I ensured all the tooltips here actually showed some useful
                        information for my designers, just in a parameter wasn't clear.
                        Now all designers had to do was right click, create a new Scriptable Object,
                        then apply it to the explosion script.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And behind the scenes, I just handled the variables, pretty
                        standard stuff here, grabbing all GameObjects and placing them
                        into a foreach loop helped a lot with organizing what to do with
                        each individual GameObject affected by explosions.
