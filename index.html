                    A JRPG style game with turn based combat built within Unreal Engine 5.
                    I'm currently a lead on this project, but I also oversee and provide assistance and guidance to the
                    programming team.

                <h2>Building Explosions with Scriptable Objects</h2>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Boom</span>
                    is a game where you control a tank, and fire at turrets and armored cars. So naturally it needed to
                    have a ton of explosions, some applying just force, some with certain VFX, most with dealing damage.
                    Since every explosion needed to have different parameters, I wanted to ensure my designers had
                    access to everything from radius to force to VFX.

                <img class="proj-img" src="Assets/ExplosionSO.png" />
                <p>
                    The first thing was to create the scriptable object.
                    I ensured all the tooltips here actually showed some useful
                    information for my designers, just in a parameter wasn't clear.
                    Now all designers had to do was right click, create a new Scriptable Object,
                    then apply it to the explosion script.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And behind the scenes, I just handled the variables, pretty
                    standard stuff here, grabbing all GameObjects and placing them
                    into a foreach loop helped a lot with organizing what to do with
                    each individual GameObject affected by explosions.
