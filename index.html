                        is a game where you control a tank, and fire at turrets and armored cars. So naturally it needed
                        there are a ton of explosions, bullets on the screen, and particle effects. For this project, I
                        wanted to really try to learn object pooling to save a little performance in the game.

                    <p>
                        The first thing was to create the scriptable object.
                        I ensured all the tooltips here actually showed some useful
                        information for my designers, just in a parameter wasn't clear.
                        Now all designers had to do was right click, create a new Scriptable Object,
                        then apply it to the explosion script.

                    <p>
                        And behind the scenes, I just handled the variables, pretty
                        standard stuff here, grabbing all GameObjects and placing them
                        into a foreach loop helped a lot with organizing what to do with
                        each individual GameObject affected by explosions.

                        to

                        damage.
                        Since every explosion needed to have different parameters, I wanted to ensure my designers had
                        access to everything from radius to force to VFX.
