                <h2>My name is Nash!</h2>
                <p>
                    Having grown up with two Caribbean parents, you can usually find me blasting reggae music while
                    cooking up a storm. Catch me in a discord call most nights hanging out with friends, nerding out
                    over paleontology books, or wondering around by a lake trying to scout a good spot to throw some
                    lines!

                    When it comes to programming games, my general philosophy is that you should make everyones lives
                    easier. Keeping things compartmentalized and organized is a big focus for me, or ensuring that
                    things are easily tweakable/testible by designers and the team. While I've previously worked on
                    systems and gameplay, I've been heavily leaning into more technical art recently. It just seems to
                    be a marriage of two things I absolutely love.

                <h3>What I play</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a sucker for a wide range of genres, from RTS games like Age of Empires and Warcraft III to
                    fighting games such as Guilty Gear and Tekken. I'm a huge fan of ARPGS
                    of all kinds; Diablo 2, Grim Dawn, Last Epoch, Path of Exile, Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor Martyr.
                    Recently I've been playing a TON of Final Fantasy 14!

                <h3>Other Stuff I do</h3>
                <p>
                    I love to cook, fish, read, and I make art! I tend to do more traditional art and linework, but I've
                    been slowing working my way into the modern age. Check out some of my traditional work below.
