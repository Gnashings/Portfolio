                <h2>My name is Nash.</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently in the game Development Program at UCF with a minor in Computer Science.
                    My main focus is programming and technical design.
                </p>
                <h3>My Design Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                    When it comes to programming in games, I often seek to create quick and simple tools to make for my
                    designers. In many of my projects, especially more recent ones, you'll find a lot of drag and drop
                    scripts for testing mechanics. Keeping things compartmentalized and organized is a big focus for me
                    in any project I work on.
                </p>
                <h3>What I play</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a sucker for a wide range of genres, from RTS games like Age of Empires and Warcraft III to
                    fighting games such as Guilty Gear and Tekken, I really enjoy just about everything.
                </p>
                <h3>Other Stuff I do</h3>
                <p>
                    I love to cook, fish, and sometimes I make art but I tend to do more
                    traditional stuff than digital, unless it's assets for a game I'm making.
