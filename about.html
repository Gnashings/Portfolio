                <h2>My name is Nash.</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently in the game Development Program at UCF with a minor in Computer Science.
                    My main focus is programming and technical design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to programming in games, I often seek to create quick and simple tools to make for my
                    designers. In many of my projects, especially more recent ones, you'll find a lot of drag and drop
                    scripts for testing mechanics. Keeping things compartmentalized and organized is a big focus for me
                    in any project I work on. I make heavy use of design patterns in my programming! State machines,
                    observer, and command patterns can all be found in my projects.
                </p>
                <h3>What I play</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a sucker for a wide range of genres, from RTS games like Age of Empires and Warcraft III to
                    fighting games such as Guilty Gear and Tekken. Recently I've been diving deep into ARPGS
                    of all kinds; Diablo 2, Grim Dawn, Last Epoch, Path of Exile, Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor Martyr.
                </p>
                <h3>Other Stuff I do</h3>
                <p>
                    I love to cook, fish, and sometimes I make art but I tend to do more
                    traditional stuff than digital, unless it's assets for a game I'm making.
